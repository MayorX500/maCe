# maCe
## make for C

Simple and easy to use C project initializer writen in 
bash for fun to autocreate makefiles with a C project.

#### Installation

```
And the mace executable will be added to your path.

You will need some extra dependencies to use maCe to the fullest.
- valgrind
- gcc
- gdb

Explained to detail there.


#### *Disclaimer*:
This was just made as a joke so that every time I created a C folder there would already be there a Makefile (*generic but usable)*, removing all the hassle of creating one.
